## What is Unix

- Linux is a **Unix-like** operating system.
- A big part of Unix software is the idea of the "_Unix philosophy_".
  - The idea is instead of having a few very specialized tools (or programs) we should have many small, composable tools that we can use to compose to solve larger problems.

## What is Linux

- Linux isn't directly Unix, just directly inspired by it, and incorporates many of its ideas and interfaces into it.

- Why Linux?
  - It's free
  - Well maintained
  - Runs just about anywhere
  - Most of the things you need already exist for it.

## How to Run Linux

- Linux can be run through a process called virtualization.
  - Virtual machines (VMs) are an operating system running within another operating system.
